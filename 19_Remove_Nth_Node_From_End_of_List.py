    """ Two Pointers; Linked List.
    We need to find the node before the node to remove.The distance between that node and tail is n.
    We use two pointers to find it. First we move one pointer n places forwardï¼Œto maintain distance
    of n between the two pinters. Then we move the two pointers at the same speed until the fast 
    pointer hit tail.
    Since the question gives that n is valid, not too many checks have to be put in place.
    
    Alternative: do not use dummy node

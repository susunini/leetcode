# Note
# Solution 1: Greedy
# Let miss be the smallest sum in [0,n] that we might be missing. Meaning we already know we can build all sums in [0,miss). 
# Then if we have a number num <= miss in the given array, we can add it to those smaller sums to build all sums in [0,miss+num). 
# If we don't, then we must add such a number to the array, and it's best to add miss itself, to maximize the reach.
